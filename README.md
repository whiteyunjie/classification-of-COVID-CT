# classification-of-COVID-CT
a simple classification task of COVID-CT

I have just participated in an interesting match about classification of COVID-CT.
# the match: https://covid-ct.grand-challenge.org/CT-diagnosis-of-COVID-19/
I just used the most common networks: DenseNet, ResNet and got some results.
